`the calculator project`

## Design > Develop > Manipulate
- The iphone calculator was the design referenced for building this calculator.
- HTML was used to outline and name all the key parts needed to build the calculator.
- Used CSS:flexbox to make all the buttons created in html to look like a calculator. Page responsiveness added via media query.
- Javascript brought our display to life and the built in js arithmetic took care of the math.
- The JS file also allowed us to share some examples of how we can manipulate the DOM.
